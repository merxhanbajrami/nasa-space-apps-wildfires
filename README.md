# Space Apps Challenge 2023 - Wildfire Map

## Overview
The project for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2023 is themed "Managing Fire: Increasing Community-based Fire Management Opportunities" and is executed for the Hackathon in North Macedonia. This project aims to provide an interactive visual representation of active wildfires in North Macedonia, providing crucial data such as the location and intensity of each fire. Additionally is enhanced by using Generative AI for generating detailed reports for the wildfires going on.

## Description
The project is a web-based application. The application visually represents active wildfires on a map, displaying relevant data to users.

### Overall structure of the web app
- A sidebar on the left, containing:
  - Logo
  - Header for active wildfires
  - A list of wildfires
  - A button to generate AI Report
- A map visualization section
- A modal for displaying AI-generated report
- An information box which is shown on mouse-over events on each wildfire marker, providing detailed data

### Functionalities of the web app
- Initializes a map centered at North Macedonia using real time data
- Uses D3 to fetch and process wildfire data from a NASA API endpoint, represented as CSV.
- Visualizes the wildfire data on the map with circle markers whose colors represent the intensity of the fires.
- Displays the top 10 intense wildfires in the sidebar.
- Implements modal control for AI-generated reports.
- Generate the report using Generative AI by referring the context-data of the active wildfires going on.


## Deployment
The application is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), a platform suitable for frontend projects and serverless functions. Vercelâ€™s Serverless Functions feature is utilized to create an API that generates the wildfire report dynamically.

### Deployment Steps
1. Push the project code to your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.
2. Connect your repository to Vercel.
3. Deploy the project on Vercel, making sure to set up the serverless function for report generation correctly.

## Setup & Installation for Local Development
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to run the application.
3. For official representation, ensure you have the rights to use laigorians official logo and replace the "logo.png" source in the `img` tag with NASA's official logo. Similarly, ensure compliance with usage rights for any other images or icons used in the project.

## Usage
- On loading, the application displays active wildfires on the map.
- Users can view details of each wildfire by hovering over the markers on the map.
- Users can generate an AI report which can be viewed by clicking the 'Generate AI Report' button. The report provides a detailed analysis of the wildfire data, formatted for easy understanding by general users.

## Dependencies
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) for mapping functionalities.
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for data manipulation and binding.
